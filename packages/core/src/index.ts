/**
 * @electron-stagewright/core
 *
 * MCP server entry point.
 *
 * Architecture summary:
 * - Server registers MCP stdio transport with @modelcontextprotocol/sdk.
 * - Tools dispatch through an ITransport abstraction with three implementations
 *   (Playwright `_electron`, CDP direct, Inspector inject).
 * - The core ships an in-process plugin model (manifest, loader, namespaced tools and
 *   error codes — see ADR-004); domain plugins ship as separate
 *   @electron-stagewright/plugin-* packages and are loaded explicitly, never auto-scanned.
